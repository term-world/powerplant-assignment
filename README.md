# KEEPING UP WITH CURRENT EVENTS, POLITICIAN PROPOSES POWER PRODUCTION FOR PLAUDITS

**Reported by `Official Mayor-Endorsed News` on `Todo`**

If you thought surveillance was a shocking trick, the Mayor's Office is all charged up about a new effort: sidelining the environment to feed the new manufacturing craze in `term-world`. As the Mayor commented during a recent presss conference, he's apparently "not the only one who's power hungry around here."

Until now, citizens haven't taken advantage of the digital riches in coal, oil, and, well renewables like solar and wind power (we guess, if you're into that) and the energizing effect they could have on the `term-world` economy. Forget about nature versus nuture, the new calling card is _nature versus neutrons_.

Each neighborhood is being asked to work together to provide a model for what electrification looks like in the world. What path will provide the charge for the future? Giga-what neighborhood will emerge as new luminaries? How will we continue to power hearth and ohm?

## Overview

In this activity, you'll:

* discover how to import custom modules and use them as `object`s
* continue to create `class`es and `object`s to achieve purpose-built tasks
* observe strange, but productive, `object` behaviors
* begin to explore the concept of `object` `inheritance`, a way to "template" mulitple objects at once


### Previous Learning Objectives

If you wish to review previous learning objectives from our assignments, you can visit the [`Syllabus`](https://chompe.rs/100-syllabus) for helpful information. However, it's also important to make an effort to retain what we have covered thus far as we progress through the course sections of the Readme might be taken out.

## Completing `powerplant` content

For this activity, you'll need to complete the following steps for all of your `woodshop` items, creating a (somewhat) autonomous factory.

For `Saw.py`, `BookshelfPlans.py`, `ChairPlans.py`, and `TablePlans.py`, you do not need to do anything. For convenience, though:



### `reflection.md`

Don't forget to finish the `reflection.md` file in the `clean-up` folder!

## Improvement suggestions

Here are some suggestions for improvements you can, **but are not limited to** use:

|Improvement Suggestions |Description        |
|:-----------------------|:------------------|



`†` If possible, also make a way to, for example, _quarry_ stone?

`††` Here, you shouldn't need to know how many board feet are required; the plans _tell_ you

`†††` The menu must also _work_ (i.e. if an object is chosen, the factory should go to work)

**Make sure to link your issue with the pull request you used to make your actually improvement.**

**If you are not following an improvement suggestion you need to have your improvement suggestion checked by the professor before proceeding.**

## Backup Policy Reminder

**While we may use this server to store code, you are responsible for using GitHub as your main backup.**

In the event that the `term-world` server goes down for any unforeseen reason, your work may be lost. Though this server is backed up on a regular (i.e. weekly) basis, there is no guarantee that up-to-the-minute data for your work will be restored.

Remember: to err is human; to back up your work is *divine*.
